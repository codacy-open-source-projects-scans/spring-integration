= Lock Advice

Starting with version 6.5, the `LockRequestHandlerAdvice` has been introduced.
This advice evaluates a lock key against a request message and performs `LockRegistry.executeLocked()` API.
The goal of the advice is to achieve exclusive access to the service invocation according to the `lockKey` context, meaning that different keys may still get concurrent access to the service.

The `LockRequestHandlerAdvice` requires a xref:distributed-locks.adoc[LockRegistry], and a static, SpEL or function-based lock key callback.
If `lockKey` is evaluated to `null`, no locking is held around service call.
However, a `discardChannel` can be provided - and such a message with a null key will be sent to this channel instead.
Also, a `waitLockDuration` option can be provided to use `Lock.tryLock(long, TimeUnit)` API instead of `Lock.lockInterruptibly()`.

Following is a sample how a `LockRequestHandlerAdvice` can be used:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
LockRegistry lockRegistry() {
    return new DefaultLockRegistry();
}

@Bean
QueueChannel discardChannel() {
    return new QueueChannel();
}

@Bean
LockRequestHandlerAdvice lockRequestHandlerAdvice(LockRegistry lockRegistry, QueueChannel discardChannel) {
    LockRequestHandlerAdvice lockRequestHandlerAdvice =
            new LockRequestHandlerAdvice(lockRegistry, (message) -> message.getHeaders().get(LOCK_KEY_HEADER));
    lockRequestHandlerAdvice.setDiscardChannel(discardChannel);
    lockRequestHandlerAdvice.setWaitLockDurationExpressionString("'PT1s'");
    return lockRequestHandlerAdvice;
}

AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger();

@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "inputChannel", adviceChain = "lockRequestHandlerAdvice")
String handleWithDelay(String payload) throws InterruptedException {
    int currentCount = this.counter.incrementAndGet();
    Thread.sleep("longer_process".equals(payload) ? 2000 : 500);
    try {
        return payload + "-" + currentCount;
    }
    finally {
        this.counter.decrementAndGet();
    }
}
